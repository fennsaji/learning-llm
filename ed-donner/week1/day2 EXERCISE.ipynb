    "Here's the scoop:\n",
    "\n",
    "The python class `OpenAI` is simply code written by OpenAI engineers that makes calls over the internet to an endpoint.  \n",
    "\n",
    "When you call `openai.chat.completions.create()`, this python code just makes a web request to the following url: \"https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Code like this is known as a \"client library\" - it's just wrapper code that runs on your machine to make web requests. The actual power of GPT is running on OpenAI's cloud behind this API, not on your computer!\n",
    "\n",
    "OpenAI was so popular, that lots of other AI providers provided identical web endpoints, so you could use the same approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "So Ollama has an endpoint running on your local box at http://localhost:11434/v1/chat/completions  \n",
    "And in week 2 we'll discover that lots of other providers do this too, including Gemini and DeepSeek.\n",
    "\n",
    "And then the team at OpenAI had a great idea: they can extend their client library so you can specify a different 'base url', and use their library to call any compatible API.\n",
    "\n",
    "That's it!\n",
    "\n",
    "So when you say: `ollama_via_openai = OpenAI(base_url='http://localhost:11434/v1', api_key='ollama')`  \n",
    "Then this will make the same endpoint calls, but to Ollama instead of OpenAI."

      "Okay, let's delve into this profoundly important question – why Jesus is considered the Messiah. It’s a question that’s at the heart of Christian faith, and it’s rooted in a complex interplay of Old Testament prophecy and the unfolding of God’s plan. Here's a breakdown, structured to address the key reasons, and acknowledging that understanding this requires a layered approach:\n",
      "\n",
      "**1. The Old Testament Messianic Prophecies:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **The Hebrew Bible's Expectation:** The Jewish people of Jesus’ time *already* had a deeply ingrained expectation of the Messiah. This expectation wasn't based on a single, clear prophecy, but rather a collection of prophecies, psalms, and writings that pointed to a future king, deliverer, and righteous leader who would restore Israel and establish God’s kingdom on earth.\n",
      "* **Key Prophecies Fulfilled by Jesus:** Christians argue that Jesus fulfills numerous Old Testament prophecies in ways that no other figure does. Let's look at some key ones:\n",
      "    * **Isaiah 7:14:** \"Behold, a virgin shall conceive and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel.” – Christians believe this prophecy refers to Mary giving birth to Jesus, connecting him directly to the divine.\n",
      "    * **Isaiah 53:5:** “But he was wounded for our transgressions, he was crushed for our iniquities; and he bore our sins in his body upon the tree.” – This is arguably the most frequently cited messianic prophecy. It describes a suffering servant who will be unjustly punished and ultimately atone for the sins of humanity, aligning perfectly with Jesus' crucifixion.\n",
      "    * **Psalm 22:** This deeply evocative psalm, describing a figure suffering and abandoned, is seen by Christians as a prophetic depiction of Jesus’ crucifixion.\n",
      "    * **Deuteronomy 18:18-19:** This passage speaks of the Messiah as a prophet, priest, and king, a single figure who would embody these roles.  Jesus, as he lived and taught, demonstrated qualities of all three.\n",
      "    * **Micah 5:2:** “But for you shall be of David, who comes from Bethlehem, saying, ‘Surely, you shall house in the name of the Lord—the Counselor, the Mighty God, the Prince of Peace.’” – This prophecy points to a descendant of David who would usher in an era of peace and represent God's authority.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "**2. Jesus’ Life and Teachings:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Miracles:**  Throughout his ministry, Jesus performed miracles – healing the sick, casting out demons, controlling nature – which were seen as evidence of his divine power and fulfillment of God’s ancient promises.\n",
      "* **Moral Teachings:** Jesus’ teachings on love, forgiveness, compassion, and justice reflected a radical moral vision that challenged the social and religious norms of his time and pointed towards God’s will for humanity.\n",
      "* **Claim to Authority:** Jesus consistently claimed to be the Son of God and the Messiah, the one who had come to reveal God’s will and offer salvation to those who would believe in him.\n",
      "\n",
      "**3. The Argument from Fulfillment:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **A Completed Prophecy:**  Christian theology argues that the messianic prophecies were *not* meant to be interpreted as open-ended predictions about any future leader, but rather as a specific blueprint for the Messiah. Jesus' life, death, and resurrection *fully* fulfilled these prophecies. This is often described as a concept of *fulfillment*.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "**Important Caveats & Considerations:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Jewish Understanding of the Messiah:** It's crucial to acknowledge that Judaism *also* has a concept of a Messiah.  However, their understanding differs significantly.  Jews traditionally anticipate a Messiah who will be a human king who will usher in an era of Jewish restoration and rule.  Christianity’s understanding of the Messiah is rooted in a belief that Jesus is both fully God and fully human, a concept distinct from the Jewish view.\n",
      "* **Interpretation:** The interpretation of Old Testament prophecies is complex and has been a subject of debate throughout Christian history. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "**In essence, Christians believe that Jesus is the Messiah because he is the one who, according to their interpretation of the Old Testament and the evidence of his life and teachings, perfectly embodies the hopes and expectations of God’s people for a savior and deliverer.**\n",
